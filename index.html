    <div id="How it Works">
      * There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
      <br />
      * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
      <br />
      * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of
      points to the player's total score.
      <br />
      * Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
      <br />
      * When they do click one, update the player's score counter.
      <br />
      * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the
      beginning of the game.
      <br />
      * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
      <br />
      * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
      <br />
      * When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number.
      Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the
      user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
      <br />
      * The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To
      that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game
